# react-basics

Learning React

# node_modules

This is where all the third party libraries and other tools are installed.

# public folder

This is where the public assets of our project exists like images and so on.

# src folder

This is where the source code of our application goes.

# index.html file

This is a basic html template with:
-> a "div id=root"(This is the container of our application).
-> ascript tag with src pointing to the entry point of our application.

# package.json file

This file contains the details of our project like the project name, version, dependencies etc.
Dev dependencies are only used for development and are not going to be deployed with our application in future.

# tsconfig.json

This is a typescript configuration file with settings that tell the typescript compiler how to compile our code to javascript.

# vite.config.ts

This is a configuration file for vite.

# Notes
"ts","tsx" are the typescript file extensions we use quite often where ".ts" is for plain typescript files and ".tsx" is for react components.
There are two ways to create a react component (We can use a JavaScript class or a function). 
Function based components are more concise and easier to use (Recommended approach for new projects).
